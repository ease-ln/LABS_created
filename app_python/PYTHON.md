## Flask pros and cons

### Pros

- Easy to understand development;
- Flask for web development allows for unit testing through its integrated support, built-in development server.

### Cons

- Flask is a singular source, it means it will handle every request in turns, one at a time.
- Using more modules is seen as a third party involvement which could be a major breach in security.

## Best practices for Python apps

1. Create a code repository and implement version control. I use GitHub.
2. README file where I describe my project and what it does.
3. Use `requirements.txt` file for Python packages.
4. Use `.gitignore` file to exclude not relevant files from the git.
5. Use virtual environment for each project for proper packages and their versions usage in the system.
6. Use linters for identifying errors.
