## Best practices for Python apps

1. Create a code repository and implement version control. I use GitHub.
2. README file where I describe my project and what it does.
3. Always begin a node project using npm init.
4. Use `.gitignore` file to exclude not relevant files from the git.
5. Always install dependencies with a --save or --save-dev.
6. Donâ€™t push node_modules to your repositories. Instead npm installs everything on development machines.
